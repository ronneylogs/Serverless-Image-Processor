# Serverless Image Processor

## Inspiration
This was originally a term project I had worked on in a first year course. Now that I'm a student in my senior year, I decided to revive it by incorporating React and AWS.

## Description
This web app allows users to upload an image and apply different image manipulations to it. The frontend is developed with ReactJS and Chakra UI. Image manipulations are done by manipulating
each individual pixel with Numpy. The web app is hosted on S3 and requests are handled with API Gateway, and Lambda. 

## Key Technologies:
- AWS
- ReactJS
- Chakra UI
- Numpy
